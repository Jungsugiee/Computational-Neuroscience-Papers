1. [Orthogonal representations for robust context-dependent task performance in brains and neural networks](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00005-8) - Timo Flesch and Chirs Summerfield

This paper investigates how populations of neurons encode multiple and conflicting tasks in context-dependent decision-making scenarios. The authors analyze both human and monkey data, and also set up two different types of neural networks—“rich” and “lazy”—to explore which best represents neural encoding. The rich network prioritizes and effectively represents relevant features, while the lazy network permits random connections to hidden layers. The paper contributes to our understanding of how neural populations learn canonical context-dependent tasks. It also provides evidence supporting the similarities in learning complex tasks between humans, monkeys, and AI, highlighting the presence of mixed selectivity in both task-relevant and non-relevant neurons. To analyze the data, the study uses dimensionality reduction techniques like MDS and PCA, alongside MRI and correlation analysis for human and monkey trials.

2. [Independent generation of sequence elements by motor cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00798-5) - Andrew Zimnik and Mark Churchland
