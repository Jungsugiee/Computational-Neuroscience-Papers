1. [Orthogonal representations for robust context-dependent task performance in brains and neural networks](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00005-8) - Timo Flesch and Chirs Summerfield

This paper utilize context-dependent decision making tasks to investigate how population of nuerons code for multiple and conflicting tasks. They analyze both humand and monkeys but also set up two different types of neural networks, rich and lazy, to investigate which one of the two better represents the encoding of neurons. The rich network prefers and represents relevant features while the lazy network allows random connections to hidden layers. This paper made contributions to discovering how population of nuerons learn canonical context-dependent tasks. It also made contributions in supporting evidence for similarities between humans, monkeys, and AI in learning complex tasks, and that they also exhibit mixed selecitvity in task-relevant and non-relevant neurons. This paper utilizes dimensionality reduction techniques like MDS and PCA while using MRI and correlation analysis for human and monkey trials.
