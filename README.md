1. [Orthogonal representations for robust context-dependent task performance in brains and neural networks](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00005-8) - Timo Flesch and Chirs Summerfield

This paper utilize context-dependent decision making tasks to investigate how population of nuerons code for multiple and conflicting tasks. They analyze both humand and monkeys but also set up two different types of neural networks, rich and lazy, to investigate which one of the two better represents the encoding of nuerons.
